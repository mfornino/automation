# Automation and the Future of Work
Repository for my Job Market Paper "Automation and the Future of Work: Assessing the Role of Labor Flexibility" (joint with Andrea Manera).

## Julia Branch

The new codes depend on the [DynamicProgramming.jl](https://github.com/mfornino/DynamicProgramming.jl) and [MarkovChains.jl](https://github.com/mfornino/MarkovChains.jl) packages.
